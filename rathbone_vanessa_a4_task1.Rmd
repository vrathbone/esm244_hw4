For Task 1, use hierarchical clustering by complete linkage to create a dendrogram showing multivariate clustering for water chemistry by site, saved as lastname_firstname_a4_task1.html. 

To perform hierarchical clustering by site, youâ€™ll want to make a data frame that has a single summary row per site (e.g. based on means from all observations at that site), then calculate the euclidean distance before performing complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

#### Exploratory visualization

First, do some exploratory data visualization, mapping species onto point color. Does it look like there is an opportunity to cluster by species? 

```{r}

# Bill length versus depth exploratory plot:
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                 y = bill_depth_mm, 
                 color = species,
                 shape = sex),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange","cyan4","darkmagenta"))

# Flipper length versus body mass exploratory plot: 
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                 y = body_mass_g, 
                 color = species,
                 shape = sex),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange","cyan4","darkmagenta"))
```
